# FiltersList 
The application was developed with the intention of helping small niche businesses in India, who offers excellent products in their categories but due to the limited resources they couldn't expose their products to the public. The application helps them to scale their businesses by providing a platform where these businesses are listed to get exposed to the public so that they get more traffic and scale their businesses to the levels they deserve.

Application is deployed to Google cloud and running [zoutletsview.com](https://zoutletsview.com/).

Slightly different version is uploaded to Github.
